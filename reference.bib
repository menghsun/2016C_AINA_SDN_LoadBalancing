@article{Hong1999,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a survey of various mobility models in both cellular networks and multi-hop networks. We show that group motion occurs frequently in ad hoc networks, and introduce a novel group mobility model- Reference Point Group Mobility (RPGM)- to represent the relationship among mobile hosts. RPGM can be readily applied to many existing applications. Moreover, by proper choice of parameters, RPGM can be used to model several mobility models which were previously proposed. One of the main themes of this paper is to investigate the impact of the mobility model on the performance of a specific network protocol or application. To this end, we have applied our RPGM model to two different network protocol scenarios, clustering and routing, and have evaluated network performance under different mobility patterns and for different protocol implementations. As expected, the results indicate that different mobility patterns affect the various protocols in different ways. In particular, the ranking of routing algorithms is influenced by the choice of mobility pattern.},

@article{Sommer2011,
abstract = {Traffic information systems are one of the key non-safety application areas of vehicular ad hoc networks. As such, TIS are much less delay sensitive than safety applications, which have recently attracted a lot of attention in VANET research. We propose a new message dissemination protocol, Adaptive Traffic Beacon (ATB), which is fully distributed and uses adaptive beaconing based on two key metrics: message utility and channel quality. It is shown that adaptive beaconing leads to much broader dissemination of messages (in terms of penetration rate) than flooding-based approaches, albeit at a slower rate. Adaptive beaconing thus seems to be much more suitable for TIS than flooding-based protocols.},

@article{Chen2012,
abstract = {Providing adequate Wi-Fi services to meet user de- mand in densely populated environments has been a fundamental challenge for Wi-Fi networks. In this paper, we explore the emerging OAMI (One-AP-Multiple-Interface) architecture and propose a unique solution called SAP (Smart Access Point). SAP takes full advantage of theOAMI architecture to provide seamless handoff experience to users, while smartly balancing the network load across multiple interfaces based on users’ time-varying traf- fic load conditions.Moreover, we define a Traffic Fulfillment (TF) performance metric to quantify the user experience and aid in association scheduling. SAP is an AP-only solution that requires trivial network modifications and is backwards compatible with legacy 802.11 stations.We have implemented SAP in theMadWifi device driver and demonstrated its effectiveness via experiments.},
