In this thesis, we proposed an adaptive load balancing scheme through association control in wireless SDN. We presented our system model as two parts: arrival event detection and adaptive load balancing. In wireless SDN, we design the mechanism that APs report their load and connection situation to controller in real time. Based on the global vision of controller, we present an algorithm on controller to derive the optimal association relationships of APs.
We compared the performance of the proposed scheme with SSF, LLF and Cell-Breathing methods through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the average AP load of the proposed scheme is $11~28\%$ higher than SSF and $26~346\%$ higher than Cell-Breathing. We check AP load in real time and shift users from heavy-load APs to light load APs, so the total throughput is higher than that in other method. Simulation results also show that the average user throughput of the proposed scheme is $16~26\%$ higher than SSF and $23~377\%$ higher than Cell-Breathing.
