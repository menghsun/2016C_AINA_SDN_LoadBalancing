In this paper, we proposed an adaptive load balancing scheme through association control in wireless SDN. 
%We presented our system model as 
The proposed scheme consists of two parts: arrival event detection and adaptive load balancing. 
%In wireless SDN, we design the mechanism that 
Through SDN-based technique, APs report their load and connection situation to controller in real time. 
Based on the global vision of controller, we presented an algorithm on controller to derive the optimal association relationship between APs.
We compared the performance of the proposed scheme with SSF, LLF and Cell-Breathing methods through simulation experiments. 
The simulation results show that the average AP load of the proposed scheme is around 11 $\sim$ 28 \% higher than SSF and $26 \sim 346\%$ higher than Cell-Breathing. 
The proposed scheme checks AP load in real time and then shifts users from heavy-loaded APs to light-loaded APs, so that the total throughput is higher than that in other methods. 
Simulation results also show that the average user throughput of the proposed scheme is $16 \sim 26\%$ higher than SSF and $23 \sim 377\%$ higher than Cell-Breathing.
